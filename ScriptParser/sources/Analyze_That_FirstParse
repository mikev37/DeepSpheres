Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair,
still brooding over the previous night's events.  Raoul sits
next to him.

187.2
I sensed it myself.  Which elements
strike you as wrong?

You really gonna do this?

VITTI

187.2
No fuckin' way.  I've had it with this

around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points
crunching into the metal sides.  Then the truck starts rising

Acting on intelligence we developed in
the last few days, the Justice
Department and the F.B.I. took very
aggressive action to recover the
stolen gold and bring the perpetrators
to justice.  I'm happy to tell the
people of New York that the streets
are safe again.

Yeah, I heard.  It's all over the
