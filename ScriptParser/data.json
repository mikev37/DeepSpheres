What hair remains is thin and falls where it may about its shoulders. It descends the rock face upside down like an insect. This is GOLLUM. He speaks in an ancient, gravely voice.

GOLLUM desperately tries to get his hands on his  precious while FRODO struggles to prevent this.  SAM recovers and grabs GOLLUM by the ankle, dragging him  away from FRODO...GOLLUM reels back and hits SAM in the face, knocking him away.
