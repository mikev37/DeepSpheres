Without another word, he continues on the hunt.  EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY  At the top of a rise, ARAGORN stops again to examine the  ground.   ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The SOUNDS OF HORSES NEIGHING BREAKS THE  AIR!   ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks up warily. He gestures to LEGOLAS and GIMLI to hasten behind a nearby rock formation to hide.  WIDE ON: The \u00c9OMER AND HIS RIDERS OF ROHAN ride over the hill.   ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks up at them passing. He walks calmly out of hiding.       WIDE ON: The HEAD HORSEMAN signals the pack with his spear.  With astonishing speed and skill, the ROHIRRIM check their steeds, wheel around, and charge the THREE.   ANGLE ON: ARAGORN is joined by LEGOLAS and GIMLI. Together,  they watch the ROHIRRIM approach.  WIDE ON: The RIDERS circle around the THREE HUNTERS tightly. They suddenly stop and point their spears at the THREE.  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN holds up his hands in surrender...\u00c9OMER rides forward and addresses them from his steed.",
