ANGLE ON: ARAGORN holds his sword at the ready.        The ELVES charge the approaching URUK-HAI. When contact is  made, ground is neither lost nor gained. ARAGORN and the ELVES valiantly battle the URUK-HAI with much success.  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN reaches below the surface of the water and pulls GIMLI to the surface. He coughs and sputters.
