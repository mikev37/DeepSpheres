ANGLE ON: The emaciated creature is dressed only in a tattered loincloth, and appears mostly human in appearance. Its frame is quite thin, but its hands, feet, and eyes are oversized. What hair remains is thin and falls where it may about its shoulders. It descends the rock face upside down like an insect. This is GOLLUM. He speaks in an ancient, gravely voice.      CRANE BEHIND GOLLUM as he climbs down.       GOLLUM reaches his hand out to snatch his prize.  SUDDENLY, the HOBBITS spring and snatch GOLLUM off the side of the rock. Amidst the struggle, GOLLUM wriggles loose and throws them both away from him.   As FRODO falls back, the RING comes out of his shirt.   GOLLUM recovers and sees the RING. He leaps straight for it. GOLLUM desperately tries to get his hands on his  precious while FRODO struggles to prevent this.  SAM recovers and grabs GOLLUM by the ankle, dragging him  away from FRODO...GOLLUM reels back and hits SAM in the face, knocking him away.   He pounces back on FRODO and reaches for the RING...FRODO  grabs Gollum\u2019s hand, and struggles against his considerable strength.   CLOSE ON: GOLLUM\u2019S cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles  with FRODO, his enormous eyes fixed on the RING.",
