      "EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY  CRANE DOWN TO: A BAND OF URUK-HAI runs across ROHAN. MERRY and PIPPIN, ride on the backs of two URUK-HAI, their hands bound around the URUK-HAIS\u2019 necks.   ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries to call to MERRY, who is unconscious  with a gash on his brow.     MERRY does not respond.   ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, the leading URUK-HAI, MA\u00daHUR, signals a  stop. He sniffs the air.  ANGLE ON: Several Orcs from the North emerge from behind some rocks. They are led by a short, crook-legged Orc, very broad with long arms that hang almost to the ground called GRISHN\u00c1KH.      ANGLE ON: UGL\u00daK looks at MA\u00daHUR amused.     ANGLE ON: GRISHN\u00c1KH\u2019S face falls.       UGL\u00daK turns away from the Northern Orcs.  ANGLE ON: GRISHN\u00c1KH mocks him as he walks away, but they make  no move on the URUK-HAI.  ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries again to rouse MERRY.     ANGLE ON: MERRY\u2019S head lolls around, unresponsive. PIPPIN looks over to an Orc drinking his draught.",
